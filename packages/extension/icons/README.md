# Icons Directory

Add your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (shown in extension management page)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often use this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (shown in extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (shown during installation and in Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- Use PNG format
- Make sure icons are clear and recognizable at all sizes
- Follow Chrome's design guidelines for extensions
- Icons should represent your extension's functionality

## Tools for Creating Icons

- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- Canva
- GIMP (free)

Until you add your own icons, the extension will use Chrome's default extension icon.
